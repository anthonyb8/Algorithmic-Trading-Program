Interactive Brokers Pairs Trading Algorithm

Project Description:
This project is built upon the Interactive Brokers Native API. Containing two parts the first is the pairs indetifier based on the cointegration of     pairs. The second is an execution system that full automates the trading of the most highly cointegrated pair.

I am constantly trying to improve and build upon.
